name: product-validation-plan
description: Designs a strategy to validate product hypotheses using the leanest possible methods, ranging from low-fidelity prototypes to production experiments and Minimum Viable Products (MVPs).
---

# **Purpose**
This skill helps product managers identify the fastest and most cost-effective ways to validate product assumptions. It differentiates between proving feasibility (Proof of Concept), testing usability (Prototypes), and validating market value (MVPs), ensuring that teams don't over-invest in unproven ideas.

## When To Use
- Use when a new feature or product idea is proposed and needs validation.
- Use to choose between different testing methods (e.g., Wizard of Oz vs. Fake Door).
- Use to define the "Critical Path" from a rough idea to an "Earliest Lovable" product.
- Use when deciding if a Proof of Concept (PoC) is necessary before building an MVP.

# **Overall Agent Process**
1. **Identify the Hypothesis:** Clarify what needs validation (Feasibility, Value, Usability, or Viability).
2. **Determine the Stage:** Select the appropriate level of fidelity (PoC, Prototype, or MVP).
3. **Select Validation Tools:** Choose specific methods from the validation toolkit based on cost and target outcome.
4. **Map the MVP Progression:** Outline the steps from "Earliest Showable" to "Earliest Lovable."
5. **Define Success Metrics:** Establish clear, measurable criteria for validation.

## Specific Process Details

### 2. Determine the Stage
- **Proof of Concept (PoC):** Focuses solely on **Feasibility**. Validates if "this can actually be built."
- **Prototype:** Visual aid for **Usability** and **Value** feedback. Can range from napkin drawings to high-fidelity wireframes.
- **Minimum Viable Product (MVP):** A production-ready version with the least number of features required to provide **Value** and validate the market hypothesis.

### 3. Validation Toolkit
Select tools based on the type of validation and budget:
- **Minimal Products:**
    - **Piecemeal:** Combine existing components ($$).
    - **Concierge:** Provide a personalized manual service ($$).
    - **Wizard of Oz:** Secretly human-powered automation ($$$).
    - **Single Feature:** Focus on one main problem ($$$).
- **Prototypes:**
    - **Task to Accomplish:** Mimic a realistic scenario ($).
    - **First-Click Testing:** Identify user expectations ($).
    - **"What Would Happen?":** Asking users to predict system behavior ($$).
    - **Card Sorting:** Assess information architecture ($).
    - **5-Second Test:** Measure message clarity ($).
    - **Thinking Aloud:** Verbalize thoughts during interaction ($).
- **Production Experiments:**
    - **Fake Door Test:** Measure interest via a "coming soon" link ($).
    - **404 Test:** Evaluate user behavior on error pages ($).
    - **A/B Testing:** Compare performance of two versions ($$).

### 4. MVP Progression (The Critical Path)
Follow the progression to ensure the product remains valuable and lovable:
1. **Earliest Showable:** Rough concept for initial feedback.
2. **Earliest Testable:** Functional enough for user testing.
3. **Earliest Usable:** Solves a core problem for the user.
4. **Earliest Likable:** Delivers a positive user experience.
5. **Earliest Lovable (MVP):** Sufficiently valuable to be sold or shipped to early adopters.

# **Final Instructions**
1. **Prioritize Value:** Always aim for the "Minimum Valuable Product" that solves a real user pain point.
2. **Differentiate PoC vs. MVP:** Remind users that a PoC proves it *can* be built, while an MVP proves it *should* be built.
3. **Oxford Commas:** Use Oxford commas in all lists.
4. **Bullet Punctuation:** Ensure all descriptive bullet points end with a period.
5. **Title Case:** Use Title Case for all headers.
