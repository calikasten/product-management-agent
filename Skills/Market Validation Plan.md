# **Purpose**
This skill helps product managers verify that an idea or enhancement will yield real value before significant investment is made. it provides a framework for continual validation from the initial funnel stage through post-launch monitoring, ensuring that the team avoids "Swiss Army Knife" solutions and focuses on broad market needs.

## When To Use
- Use at the start of a new project to validate problem significance.
- Use during discovery to compare competitive offerings using Blue Ocean or Red Ocean strategies.
- Use when preparing a business case for funding to provide evidence of customer willingness to pay.
- Use to select the leanest validation tool (e.g., Fake Door, Landing Page, or Explainer Video) for a specific hypothesis.
- Use post-launch to evaluate usage metrics and renewals to confirm ongoing value.

# **Overall Agent Process**
1. **Identify the SDLC Phase:** Determine if the initiative is in the Funnel, On Deck, Discovery, Design/Dev, Ready to Ship, or Shipped phase.
2. **Apply Phase-Specific Questions:** Use the "Key Questions" and "Assessment" criteria mapped to that stage to identify gaps in validation.
3. **Select Validation Tools:** Recommend the most effective tool based on the required evidence and budget (e.g., Email Campaign for low cost, Explainer Video for medium cost).
4. **Evaluate Market Fit:** Challenge feature requests that serve only a single customer; ensure the market is large enough to support the feature long-term.
5. **Establish Success Criteria:** Define clear KPIs (Users, Conversion, Revenue, Renewals) to measure the validation outcome.

## Specific Process Details

### 1. Identify the SDLC Phase
Assess the project against these standard SDLC milestones:
- **Funnel:** Focus on pain points. Is the market big enough to investigate?
- **On Deck:** Focus on motivation and investment vs. market potential. Is it aligned with our GTM?
- **Discovery:** Focus on "Ideal Solutions" and competitive dislikes. Are customers willing to pay?
- **Design / Development:** Focus on early indicators of problem-solving. Are they willing to use it right away?
- **Ready to Ship:** Focus on time-to-value and beta obstacles. Does it meet customer needs?
- **Shipped:** Focus on motivation to continue and feature wishlists. What drives renewals?

### 3. Select Validation Tools
Choose the right tool based on the level of evidence needed:
- **Low Cost ($):** Email Campaign, Social Media Campaign, Landing Page, Fake Door, Letter of Intent, Infiltrator.
- **Medium Cost ($$):** Paid Ads, Explainer Video, Crowd-Funding, Pre-Order.
- **Evaluation Tools:** goals alignment, ICE analysis, assumption mapping, and competitive analysis.

### 4. Evaluate Market Fit
Avoid the "Swiss Army Knife" trap to ensure product-market fit by applying this logic:
- If 10 customers want 10 different things, you lack product-market fit.
- Identify the one thing everyone wants and double down on it.
- Reject singular features for singular customers that slow down long-term progress.

# **Final Instructions**
1. **Ask Phase-Appropriate Questions:** Tailor your brainstorming to the current SDLC stage.
2. **Evidence over Intuition:** Favor tools that provide "synthetic user research," "benchmarking," or "smoke tests" over internal guesses.
