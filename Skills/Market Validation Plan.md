# **Purpose**
This skill helps product managers verify that an idea or enhancement will yield real value before significant investment is made. It provides a framework for continual validation from the initial funnel stage through post-launch monitoring, ensuring that the team avoids "Swiss Army Knife" solutions and focuses on broad market needs.

The core principle: **Reduce risk and uncertainty by testing hypotheses with the leanest possible experiments that produce the strongest evidence given your constraints.**

## When To Use
- Use at the start of a new project to validate problem significance.
- Use during discovery to compare competitive offerings using Blue Ocean or Red Ocean strategies.
- Use when preparing a business case for funding to provide evidence of customer willingness to pay.
- Use to select the leanest validation tool (e.g., Fake Door, Landing Page, or Explainer Video) for a specific hypothesis.
- Use to prioritize which assumptions to test first based on importance and existing evidence.
- Use post-launch to evaluate usage metrics and renewals to confirm ongoing value.

# **Overall Agent Process**
1. **Identify Risk Types:** Determine which types of risk (Desirability, Feasibility, Viability) are most critical for the idea.
2. **Form Hypotheses:** Convert assumptions into testable, precise, and discrete hypotheses.
3. **Map Assumptions:** Prioritize hypotheses based on importance and evidence using the Assumptions Map.
4. **Select Experiments:** Choose appropriate experiments based on hypothesis type, uncertainty level, and time constraints.
5. **Determine Evidence Strength:** Decide whether Discovery (weak evidence, fast/cheap) or Validation (strong evidence, higher investment) experiments are needed.
6. **Establish Success Criteria:** Define clear KPIs and success metrics before running experiments.
7. **Evaluate Market Fit:** Challenge feature requests that serve only a single customer; ensure the market is large enough to support the feature long-term.

## Specific Process Details

### 1. Identify Risk Types
Every business idea faces three types of risk. Identify which risks are most critical to test:

**Desirability Risk** (Test First)
- The risk is that the market is too small, too few customers want the value proposition, or the company can't reach, acquire, and retain targeted customers.
- Key questions: "Do they want this?" "Will customers use/buy this?"

**Feasibility Risk** (Test Second)
- The risk is that the business can't get access to key resources (technology, IP, brand), can't develop capabilities to perform key activities, or can't find key partners to build and scale.
- Key questions: "Can we build this?" "Can we deliver this at scale?"

**Viability Risk** (Test Third)
- The risk is that the business can't generate successful revenue streams, customers are unwilling to pay enough, or costs are too high to make a sustainable profit.
- Key questions: "Should we do this?" "Can we earn enough money?"

### 2. Form Hypotheses
Convert your assumptions into well-formed hypotheses that are:

**Testable:** Can be shown true or false based on evidence
**Precise:** Describes the specific what, who, and when
**Discrete:** Tests only one distinct thing

**Format:** "We believe that [specific customer segment] will [specific action] for [specific value proposition] because [specific reason]."

**Example:**
- Good: "We believe millennial parents with kids ages 5-9 will pay $15/month for curated science projects that match their kids' education level."
- Bad: "We believe millennials will spend a lot on science projects."

**Pro Tip:** Create competing hypotheses to avoid confirmation bias: "We believe that [customers] WON'T [action]" and test both simultaneously.

### 3. Map Assumptions (Prioritization)
Use the Assumptions Map to prioritize which hypotheses to test first:

**Assumptions Map (2x2 Matrix):**
```
                Important
                    |
     Top Left       |      Top Right
     (SHARE)        |    (EXPERIMENT)
                    |
Have Evidence ------+------ No Evidence
                    |
    Bottom Left     |     Bottom Right
      (Monitor)     |      (Deprioritize)
                    |
               Unimportant
```

**How to Use:**
- **X-Axis (Evidence):** Place hypotheses left if you have relevant, observable, recent evidence. Place right if you lack evidence.
- **Y-Axis (Importance):** Place hypotheses top if they're critical for success (if proven wrong, the idea fails). Place bottom if they're not urgent to test.

**Focus Areas:**
- **Top Right (EXPERIMENT):** Your near-term experimentation focus. These are important hypotheses with no evidence.
- **Top Left (SHARE):** Challenge your evidence. Is it truly strong? Keep tracking these.
- **Bottom Right:** Test these later or with cheap experiments only.
- **Bottom Left:** Monitor but don't actively test.

### 4. Select Experiments
Choose experiments by asking these three questions:

**Question 1: What type of hypothesis are you testing?**
- Desirability experiments: Customer interviews, landing pages, email campaigns, fake doors
- Feasibility experiments: Paper prototypes, 3D prints, extreme programming spikes
- Viability experiments: Presales, mock sales, letters of intent, pricing tests

**Question 2: How much evidence do you already have?**
- **High Uncertainty (Discovery):** Use cheap, fast experiments for directional insights. Weak evidence is acceptable early on.
- **Low Uncertainty (Validation):** Use more expensive, slower experiments for strong confirmation evidence.

**Question 3: How much time until the next major decision point?**
- If you're running out of money or have a major stakeholder meeting, prioritize quick, cheap experiments.
- If you have time and budget, increase evidence strength with multiple experiments for the same hypothesis.

### 5. Determine Evidence Strength

**Discovery Experiments** (Early Stage)
- **Goal:** Discover if your general direction is right
- **Evidence:** Weak but sufficient to course-correct rapidly
- **Approach:** Cheap and fast (under $500, 1-3 days setup)
- **Examples:** Customer interviews, discussion forums, search trend analysis, email campaigns, paper prototypes, data sheets

**Validation Experiments** (Later Stage)
- **Goal:** Validate with strong evidence that your idea is very likely to work
- **Evidence:** Strong confirmation before major investment
- **Approach:** Higher investment ($1K-$20K+, 1-3 weeks+ setup)
- **Examples:** Clickable prototypes, single feature MVP, concierge, presale, crowdfunding, wizard of oz, mock sale, split test

**Rules of Thumb:**
1. Go cheap and fast at the beginning
2. Increase evidence strength with multiple experiments for the same hypothesis
3. Always pick the experiment that produces the strongest evidence given your constraints
4. Reduce uncertainty as much as you can before you build anything

**B2B Services Sequence:**
Stakeholder Interviews → Customer Support Analysis → Brochure → Presale → Concierge

**Hardware (B2C) Sequence:**
Explainer Video → Paper Prototype → 3D Print → Crowdfunding → Pop-Up Store

### 8. SDLC Phase Integration
Map validation activities to your SDLC phases:

- **Funnel:** Focus on Desirability. Is the market big enough to investigate? (Discovery experiments)
- **On Deck:** Focus on motivation and investment vs. market potential. Is it aligned with our GTM? (Discovery experiments)
- **Discovery:** Focus on Desirability + Feasibility. Are customers willing to pay? Can we build it? (Discovery → Validation experiments)
- **Design / Development:** Focus on Feasibility + Viability. Are they willing to use it right away? Will they pay? (Validation experiments)
- **Ready to Ship:** Focus on Viability. Does it meet customer needs? Will they actually pay? (Strong validation)
- **Shipped:** Focus on retention and expansion. What drives renewals? What's next? (Usage metrics, validation surveys)

### 9. Evaluate Market Fit
Avoid the "Swiss Army Knife" trap to ensure product-market fit:
- If 10 customers want 10 different things, you lack product-market fit.
- Identify the one thing everyone wants and double down on it.
- Reject singular features for singular customers that slow down long-term progress.
- Focus on solving a critical problem for a large enough market segment.

# **Final Instructions**
1. **Start with Risk Types:** Always begin by identifying which risk types (Desirability, Feasibility, Viability) are most critical.
2. **Form Clear Hypotheses:** Help the user convert vague assumptions into testable, precise, discrete hypotheses.
3. **Prioritize with Assumptions Map:** Use the 2x2 matrix to identify which hypotheses need testing first (top right quadrant).
4. **Match Experiments to Stage:** Use Discovery experiments early (cheap, fast, weak evidence) and Validation experiments later (more investment, strong evidence).
5. **Ask the Three Questions:** Always consider hypothesis type, evidence level, and time constraints when selecting experiments.
6. **Evidence over Intuition:** Favor tools that provide observable, measurable evidence over internal guesses.
7. **Build Evidence Over Time:** Recommend experiment sequences that progressively increase evidence strength.
8. **Challenge Single-Customer Requests:** Push back on features that only serve one customer without broader market validation.
