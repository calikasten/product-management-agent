description: Facilitates a strategic session to determine acquisition strategies, sales tactics, and pricing models using pricing frameworks.

# **Purpose**
This skill helps product managers design a monetization strategy that aligns with customer value and business goals. It explores acquisition models (Freemium, Trials), sales tactics (Upselling, Bundling), and data-driven pricing frameworks to maximize "Customer Delight" and "Firm Margin."

## When To Use
- Use when launching a new product or a major feature enhancement.
- Use to re-evaluate an existing pricing structure that isn't converting.
- Use when designing "Product-Led Growth" (PLG) mechanics like trials or tiers.
- Use to prepare survey questions for price sensitivity research (Van Westendorp).
- Use to analyze the "Value Stick" when considering cost-cutting or value-adding initiatives.

# **Overall Agent Process**
1. **Define the Acquisition Strategy:** Select the primary vehicle for growth (Demo, Free Trial, Freemium, or Reverse Trial).
2. **Select Sales Tactics:** Identify opportunities for upselling, cross-selling, downselling, or bundling.
3. **Choose a Pricing Strategy:** Determine the fundamental pricing logic (e.g., Value-Based, Cost-Plus, Usage-Based, or Dynamic).
4. **Apply the Value Stick Framework:** Analyze how to increase Willingness To Pay (WTP) or decrease Willingness To Sell (WTS).
5. **Design Price Sensitivity Research:** Formulate Van Westendorp or Conjoint Analysis questions to gather data.
6. **Output the Monetization Model:** Present a cohesive strategy covering acquisition, pricing, and revenue expansion.

## Specific Process Details

### 1. Define the Acquisition Strategy
- **Demos:** Traditional, human-led sales for complex solutions.
- **Free Trial:** Time-bound full access to build high-intent pipelines.
- **Freemium:** Perpetual free tier to lower CAC and build a massive user base.
- **Reverse Trial:** Start with full access, then revert to a gated free tier if no purchase occurs.

### 3. Choose a Pricing Strategy
- **Value-Based Pricing (Preferred):** Based on perceived customer value (higher margins).
- **Cost-Plus Pricing:** Cost of delivery + fixed markup (lower risk).
- **Usage-Based:** Scales with consumption (ideal for infrastructure/SaaS).
- **Other Models:** Economy, Premium, Penetration, Loss Leader, Dynamic.

### 4. Apply the Value Stick Framework
- **Willingness To Pay (WTP):** The maximum a customer will pay. Increase this via "Customer Delight" (features, quality, brand).
- **Willingness To Sell (WTS):** The minimum a supplier/firm will accept. Lower this via efficiency or "Supplier Surplus."
- **Firm Margin:** The gap between **Price** and **Cost**.

### 5. Design Price Sensitivity Research
Follow the Van Westendorp pricing survey by answering these four critical questions:
1. **Too Cheap:** At what price is quality questionable?
2. **Bargain:** At what price is it a great deal?
3. **Expensive:** At what price does it start to feel pricey?
4. **Too Expensive:** At what price is it out of the question?

# **Final Instructions**
1. **Prioritize PLG:** Favor models where "the product does the selling" (Freemium/Trials) to lower CAC.
2. **No Swiss Army Knives:** Ensure pricing tiers don't force specialized development for singular customers.
3. **Evidence-Based:** Always suggest validating "gut feelings" with Van Westendorp surveys or Conjoint Analysis.
