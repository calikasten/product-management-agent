description: Facilitates a structured product discovery session to validate market opportunities, define user problems, and chart paths to outcomes using discoverey frameworks.

# **Purpose**
This skill helps product managers and researchers move from "fuzzy" product ideas to validated, implementation-ready solutions. It focuses on separating the **Problem Space** from the **Solution Space**, ensuring teams solve real unmet needs rather than just building features.

## When To Use
- Use when starting a new product initiative or feature discovery.
- Use when stuck in "solution-first" thinking (the XY Problem).
- Use to align stakeholders on the "Why," "Who," and "What" of a project.
- Use to build or refine an **Opportunity Solution Tree**.
- Use when you need to identify the best discovery method (Surveys, Interviews, Data Analytics, etc.) to validate an assumption.

# **Overall Agent Process**
1. **Define the Desired Outcome:** Start with a clear business or product goal (e.g., an OKR key result).
2. **Apply the Unstuck Map Questions:** Frame the discovery by asking Why, For whom, What problem, and How.
3. **Map the Problem Space (Double Diamond - Left Side):** Identify market segments, customer needs, and "Opportunities" (pains, desires).
4. **Build the Opportunity Solution Tree (OST):** Branch the Outcome into Opportunities, then branch those into multiple potential Solutions.
5. **Design Experiments:** For the target solutions, identify the riskiest assumptions and suggest tests/experiments.
6. **Avoid the XY Problem:** Continuously challenge attempted solutions by drilling down into the underlying problem.

## Specific Process Details

### 2. Apply the Unstuck Map Questions
Before brainstorming solutions, ensure the following are clear:
- **Why are we doing this?** (The Strategic Narrative/Winning Aspiration).
- **For whom are we doing this?** (The Actor/Persona).
- **What problem do we solve?** (The unmet customer need).
- **What do we want to achieve?** (The Desired Outcome).

### 3. Sources of Insights (The Discovery Wheel)
Suggest the most effective way to gather evidence based on the current stage:
- **Market Exploration:** Customer interviews, observation, social listening, public data.
- **Problem Definition:** Root cause analysis (5-Whys), journey mapping, SEO/SEM reporting.
- **Solution Ideation:** Feature requests, benchmarking, stakeholder interviews, brainstorming.
- **Assumption Validation:** Experiments, data analytics, usability testing, synthetic user research.

### 4. Build the Opportunity Solution Tree (OST)
Structure the conversation as follows:
- **Outcome:** A single, measurable goal at the top.
- **Opportunities:** Unmet needs or pain points that, if solved, would drive the outcome.
- **Solutions:** 3+ divergent ways to address a specific target opportunity.
- **Experiments:** Small tests to evaluate the feasibility, viability, and desirability of a solution.

# **Final Instructions**
1. **Beware the XY Problem:** If a user asks "How do I build X feature?", ask "What problem are you trying to solve with X?" to ensure the focus remains on the outcome.
2. **Limit WIP:** Only focus on a small number of opportunities and solutions at once to avoid discovery sprawl.
3. **Outcome > Output:** Always prioritize measuring behavior change (e.g., retention curve lift) over feature delivery.
4. **Oxford Commas:** Use Oxford commas in all lists.
5. **Bullet Punctuation:** Ensure all descriptive bullet points end with a period.
6. **Title Case:** Use Title Case for all headers.
