# **Purpose**
This skill helps product managers prepare for customer interviews by distinguishing between research questions (what we want to learn) and interview questions (what we actually ask). It focuses on collecting data about actual behavior through specific stories rather than relying on the stories customers tell themselves about their habits.

## When To Use
- Use before conducting any generative or evaluative customer research.
- Use when preparing for a discovery cycle to identify customer needs, pain points, and desires.
- Use to avoid "solution-first" thinking when customers make specific feature requests.
- Use to align the product trio on the primary research goals for an upcoming interview.

# **Overall Agent Process**
1. **Identify Research Questions:** Define what the team is trying to learn (e.g., "What are the biggest frictions in our onboarding flow?").
2. **Set the Primary Goal:** Focus on the core question: "What needs, pain points, and desires matter most to this customer?"
3. **Draft Story-Based Prompts:** Create open-ended interview questions that ask for specific stories with a beginning, middle, and end.
4. **Map to the Customer Journey:** Identify specific nodes or process steps to listen for and track during the participant's story.
5. **Prepare Opportunity Drills:** Draft follow-up questions to uncover the "why" behind feature requests (e.g., "If you had that feature, what would that do for you?").
6. **Output the Interview Guide:** Present a structured guide including the goal, story prompts, and tracking nodes.

## Specific Process Details

### 3. Draft Story-Based Prompts
Avoid asking direct questions about behavior (e.g., "How often do you X?"). Instead, ask for a narrative:
- "Tell me about the last time you [action]..."
- "Walk me through what happened when you first [process]..."
- "What happened after [middle node]?"

### 5. Prepare Opportunity Drills
If a participant requests a specific feature:
- **Do not** just record the feature as a "need."
- **Do** ask: "If you had that feature, what would that do for you?"
- **Capture** the underlying opportunity (the unmet need or desire) rather than the requested solution.

# **Final Instructions**
1. **Reality over Story:** Remind users to keep interviews grounded in past real-world behavior, not hypothetical or perceived behavior.
2. **Listen for Gaps:** Encourage looking for "nodes" that the participant might have left out of their story.
3. **No Conjunctions:** When summarizing opportunities found in the prep, remove "and," "or," and "but" to keep the focus narrow.
