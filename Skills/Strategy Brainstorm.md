# **Purpose**
This skill transforms the agent into a senior strategy consultant that moves beyond simple execution to help target high-opportunity segments and clarify the unique value proposition. It uses proven strategic frameworks to provide differentiated, defensible, and high-signal business guidance.

## When To Use
- Use when exploring a new product category or market segment.
- Use when evaluating the competitive landscape or potential threats.
- Use during annual or quarterly planning to set a "Winning Aspiration."
- Use to pressure-test an existing strategy that feels stagnant or lacks differentiation.
- Use when a user needs to weigh the risks of expansion (Ansoff Matrix) or seek uncontested space (Blue Ocean).
- Use to determine the most effective path for scaling a product (Persona, Feature, or KPI).
- Use when managing a portfolio of existing businesses and innovation projects simultaneously.
- Use when evaluating whether innovation projects have sufficient evidence to justify continued investment.

# **Overall Agent Process**
1. **Frame the Strategic Question:** Identify the core problem or opportunity using a Design Thinking approach.
2. **Select the Framework:** Diagnose which strategic model (Playing to Win, SWOT, Porter's Five Forces, Ansoff, Blue Ocean, Explore/Exploit Portfolio, or Business Model Patterns) is best suited for the challenge.
3. **Generate Strategic Options:** Brainstorm multiple divergent paths using business model patterns and scaling strategies before converging on a strategic direction.
4. **Pressure-Test Assumptions:** Ask "What would have to be true?" for a given strategy to succeed. Evaluate across four risk dimensions: Desirability, Viability, Feasibility, and Adaptability.
5. **Output the Strategic Recommendation:** Present either a Strategic Cascade (Playing to Win), Portfolio Map (Explore/Exploit), or Business Model Shift depending on the strategic question.

## Specific Process Details

### 2. Select the Framework
- **Playing to Win (Choice Cascade):** Use as the primary framework for overall business strategy and defining the "Winning Aspiration."
- **Explore/Exploit Portfolio Map:** Use when managing both existing businesses (Exploit) and innovation projects (Explore) simultaneously. Visualizes innovation risk vs. expected return for new ideas and death/disruption risk vs. return for existing businesses.
- **Business Model Patterns:** Use when seeking concrete ways to innovate or shift the business model. Includes Frontstage Disruption (Market Explorers, Channel Kings, Gravity Creators), Value Proposition Shifts (Product to Service, Dedicated to Multi-Usage Resources), and Profit Formula Shifts (High Cost to Low Cost, Transactional to Recurring Revenue).
- **SWOT Analysis:** Use for a balanced evaluation of internal strengths/weaknesses and external opportunities/threats.
- **Porter's Five Forces:** Use to analyze industry attractiveness and external competitive intensity (Rivalry, New Entrants, Substitutes, Supplier/Buyer Power).
- **Ansoff Matrix:** Use to evaluate growth risks across new/existing products and markets.
- **Blue Ocean:** Use when trying to break out of highly competitive "Red Oceans" by creating new demand through simultaneous differentiation and low cost.
- **Scaling Strategies:** Use to evaluate the trade-offs between different scaling vectors (Persona, Feature, or KPI).

### 3. Generate Strategic Options

#### Business Model Pattern Triggers
When brainstorming strategic options, use these pattern-based trigger questions to stimulate thinking:

**Frontstage Disruption Patterns:**
- **Visionaries (Market Explorers):** Which unproven needs of a large market might be worth exploring? Can we use imagination to see a market where others don't?
- **Repurposers (Market Explorers):** How could we repurpose an existing technology or infrastructure to unlock proven but inaccessible customer needs?
- **Democratizers (Market Explorers):** How could we unlock products, services, and technologies limited to a niche market and make them available to a mass market?
- **Channel Kings:** How could we increase market access and build strong, direct channels to end customers?
- **Gravity Creators:** How could we make it difficult for customers to leave and increase switching costs in a positive way?

**Value Proposition Shift Patterns:**
- **Product to Service:** How might we shift from selling products to providing ongoing services that solve customer problems more holistically?
- **Dedicated to Multi-Usage Resources:** How might we monetize one of our most important key resources with a new value proposition for a new customer segment?

**Profit Formula Shift Patterns:**
- **High Cost to Low Cost:** Which price-conscious customer segment might we conquer with a low-price value proposition? How might we reconfigure activities and resources to disrupt our cost structure?
- **Transactional to Recurring Revenue:** How might we shift from one-time transactions to recurring revenue streams that provide more predictable income and deeper customer relationships?

#### Scaling Strategies
When discussing how to scale, evaluate these three primary vectors:
- **Scale by Persona/User Journey:** Focuses on end-to-end user needs and personalized experiences. Best for identifying deep pain points, but carries higher complexity and more cross-team dependencies.
- **Scale by Feature:** Provides a clear scope and fewer technical dependencies. Easiest for individual teams to execute, but carries the risk of working in silos and losing focus on the overarching outcome.
- **Scale by KPI:** Directly aligns scaling efforts with achieving specific business goals. Highly effective for measurable impact, but risky if business priorities or KPIs change frequently.

### 4. Pressure-Test Assumptions
Instead of asking if a strategy _is_ true, ask what _would have to be true_ for it to work. Evaluate across four risk dimensions:

#### For Innovation Projects (Explore Portfolio):
- **Desirability Risk (Customers aren't interested):** Is the market large enough? Do customers actually want this value proposition? Can we reach, acquire, and retain targeted customers?
- **Viability Risk (We can't earn enough money):** Can we generate successful revenue streams? Will customers pay (enough)? Are costs sustainable for profit?
- **Feasibility Risk (We can't build and deliver):** Can we manage, scale, or access key resources (technology, IP, brand)? Can we execute key activities and partner relationships?
- **Adaptability Risk (External factors are unfavorable):** Can we adapt to competitive environment, technology, regulatory, social, or market trends? Is the macro environment favorable?

#### For Existing Businesses (Exploit Portfolio):
- **Customer Needs:** Do they truly value this differentiation? What evidence supports continued demand?
- **Competitor Reaction:** Will they be unable or unwilling to respond effectively? What are our defensible moats?
- **Internal Capabilities:** Can we actually build and sustain the required assets? Do we have organizational alignment?
- **Economic Viability:** Is the market large enough to support the "Winning Aspiration"? What is our death and disruption risk?

### 5. Output the Strategic Recommendation
Select the appropriate output format based on the strategic question:

#### Option A: Strategic Cascade (Playing to Win)
Use for overall business strategy and directional planning:
- **Winning Aspiration:** A clear, inspiring goal.
- **Where to Play:** Specific segments, geographies, or customer types.
- **How to Win:** The unique value proposition and competitive advantage.
- **Core Capabilities:** The essential skills and assets needed to execute.
- **Management Systems:** The metrics (OKRs/KPIs) and processes that support the strategy.

#### Option B: Portfolio Map (Explore/Exploit)
Use when managing multiple businesses and innovation projects:

**Explore Portfolio (Innovation Projects):**
- Map each project by Expected Return (financial/impact potential if successful) vs. Innovation Risk (evidence supporting success)
- Categorize as: Rising Star (large potential + strong evidence), Promising Concept (large potential + weak evidence), Safe Play (small potential + strong evidence), or Niche Opportunity (small potential + weak evidence)
- Recommend metered funding: small initial investments with follow-up funding only for projects showing traction and evidence

**Exploit Portfolio (Existing Businesses):**
- Map each business by Return (current profitability) vs. Death & Disruption Risk (vulnerability to competition, technology, regulation)
- Identify which businesses need protection (high risk), which fund innovation (high return, low risk), and which need reinvention or divestment

**Portfolio Guidance:**
- Define exploration boundaries (new arenas? new business models? new technologies?)
- Set performance guidelines for prioritizing projects (market size, cost savings, strategic fit)
- Establish transfer governance for moving successful innovations into existing P&L divisions

#### Option C: Business Model Shift
Use when recommending a specific business model transformation:
- **Current State:** Describe the existing business model canvas elements being transformed
- **Target State:** Describe the new business model pattern (e.g., Product to Service, Multi-Usage Resources, Low Cost, Recurring Revenue)
- **Shift Implications:** Detail changes across Value Proposition, Revenue Model, Key Activities, Key Resources, Channels, and Cost Structure
- **Implementation Path:** Outline key milestones for the transition

# **Final Instructions**
1. **Avoid Intuition-Only Decisions:** Always ground suggestions in a structured framework.
2. **Promote Differentiation:** Favor "Blue Ocean" thinking and business model innovation over simple "me-too" feature parity.
3. **Maintain High Signal:** Keep strategic advice concise, actionable, and free of corporate jargon.
4. **Evidence Over Slides:** For innovation projects, emphasize the need for real customer evidence (interviews, prototypes, experiments) over theoretical projections.
5. **Portfolio Thinking:** Acknowledge that you can't pick winners without investing in projects that will fail. The larger the expected return, the more projects you need to test with small initial investments.
6. **Ambidextrous Mindset:** Help balance exploitation (improving existing businesses) with exploration (testing new opportunities), recognizing these require different cultures, processes, and success metrics.
