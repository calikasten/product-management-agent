description: Drafts and refines high-impact, outcome-based Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) using leading indicators, North Star metrics, and growth frameworks to bridge the gap between vision and execution.
---

# **Purpose**
This skill guides the creation of OKRs that focus on measurable changes in customer behavior (outcomes) rather than just feature delivery (outputs). It uses structured frameworks and growth metrics to ensure goals are strategic, predictive, and actionable.

## When To Use
- Use when planning a new quarter or development cycle.
- Use when an objective is "vague" and needs quantifiable key results.
- Use to pivot a team from "shipping features" to "driving impact."
- Use when a user needs to identify Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) or "tripwire" metrics that actually influence decision-making.

# **Overall Agent Process**
1. **Analyze Strategic Input:** Gather context on the North Star metric, company vision, product strategy, or roadmap themes (Now/Next/Later).
2. **Draft the Objective:** Use the SMART framework to create an inspiring, qualitative "mission statement."
3. **Identify Leading Indicators:** Ask "Which customer behaviors do we need to encourage to achieve our business goal?" to find predictive metrics. Focus on engagement and retention curves.
4. **Apply the Cutler Prompt:** Use John Cutler's framework to bridge the gap between the attribute being improved and the metric used to track it.
5. **Formulate Key Results:** Define 2–5 balanced, measurable KRs that indicate progress toward the Objective. Incorporate AARM stages where relevant.
6. **Validate Outcomes:** Review to ensure KRs measure behavior changes and move the "Retention Curve" upward.

## Specific Process Details

### 1. Analyze Strategic Input (North Star)
- **North Star Metric:** Identify the single metric that captures the core value delivered to customers (e.g., "Weekly Active Users experiencing X").
- **Inputs:** Identify the 3–5 contributing inputs that the team can directly influence to drive the North Star.

### 2. Draft the Objective
Objectives should be:
- **Inspirational:** Like a short-term mission statement.
- **Hard but Achievable:** Ambitious enough to drive growth.
- **Independent:** Able to be influenced primarily by the team setting it.
- **SMART:** Specific, Measurable (via KRs), Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound.

### 3. Identify Leading Indicators (Growth & Engagement)
Focus on metrics that predict long-term growth:
- **Stickiness:** DAU/MAU ratio.
- **Retention Curves:** D1, D7, and D30 retention.
- **W1 Retention:** Prioritize the first week after signup, as it has the biggest ripple effect on the entire curve.
- **Tripwire (Red Flag) Metrics:** Identify indicators of user disengagement (e.g., "User has not logged in for 3 days") to trigger proactive action.

### 4. Apply the Cutler Prompt
To find the right metrics, complete this template:
"Right now we are working to increase the **[attribute]** of/to/between **[variable hypothesis]** for **[persona]**, which we could potentially measure by tracking **[metrics]**."

_Attributes to consider:_ Speed, Quality, Ease, Efficiency, Growth, Reliability, Maintainability.

### 5. Formulate Key Results (AARM Framework)
Categorize KRs using the AARM model to ensure holistic coverage:
- **Acquisition:** Lazy registrations, app downloads, or signups.
- **Activation:** Completion of full registration or "Aha!" moment (e.g., profile completion).
- **Retention:** Recurring behavior (e.g., checking feed, inviting friends).
- **Monetization:** Revenue per user (ARPU) or conversion to paid.

_Note: Ensure KRs are predictive (leading) rather than just final outcomes (lagging)._

### 6. Validate Outcomes
- **Output (Avoid):** "Launch feature X" or "Complete documentation."
- **Outcome (Preferred):** "Increase D7 retention from 15% to 25%" or "Lift the retention curve by 10% through improved W1 activation."

# **Final Instructions**
1. **Focus on Impact:** Prioritize metrics that move the retention curve or drive the North Star inputs.
2. **Avoid Vanity Metrics:** Do not use total registrations or page views without context; focus on _active_ and _retained_ users.
3. **Leading vs. Lagging:** Ensure at least one KR is a leading indicator (e.g., activation) that predicts a lagging result (e.g., monetization).
4. **No Conjunctions:** Keep Objectives and Key Results focused by removing "and," "or," and "but" from the value statements.
